# Image Resizer Application

A simple Python-based GUI application to resize images to custom dimensions. Built using the Tkinter library for the interface and Pillow for image processing.

## Features

- **Select Image**: Browse and select an image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) for resizing.
- **Custom Dimensions**: Input desired width and height to resize the image.
- **Resize and Save**: Resized images are saved in the same directory as the original with a new filename (`resized_<original_name>`).
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface with a customizable background.

## Requirements

Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the following libraries:

- `Pillow`: For image processing and manipulation.
- `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface (comes pre-installed with Python).

## Installation

**Run the application:**
python app.py

**Select an image file using the Browse button.
Enter the desired width and height.
Click Resize Images to process the image. The resized image will be saved in the same directory as the original.**
**Notes**

1. Ensure the input image file is valid and supported (e.g., .png, .jpg, .jpeg).
2. Width and height must be positive integers.
